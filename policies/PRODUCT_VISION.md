Authoritative product intent and vision document for the Dayflow HRMS project
This file defines what the product is, why it exists, who it is for, and what success means.
All design, development, and AI‑generated decisions must align with this vision.

1. Product Overview
Dayflow is a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) designed to digitize and simplify day‑to‑day HR operations within an organization.

The system focuses on:

Employee self‑service

Administrative oversight

Clear approval workflows

Transparency of HR processes

Dayflow is intentionally designed as a frontend‑first, workflow‑driven application that demonstrates how HR systems function in practice.

2. Product Purpose
The purpose of Dayflow is to:

Replace manual HR processes with structured digital flows

Provide employees with visibility into their own HR data

Enable HR/Admin users to manage employees efficiently

Demonstrate core HRMS concepts clearly and intuitively

This product is built to show understanding of HR workflows, not to replicate enterprise‑grade systems.

3. Target Users
Dayflow explicitly supports only two user personas.

3.1 Employee
An employee is a regular staff member who needs to:

View and manage their own HR information

Perform daily actions such as attendance marking

Apply for leave and track approval status

View payroll details (read‑only)

Employees are consumers of HR services, not administrators.

3.2 Admin / HR Officer
An Admin (or HR Officer) is responsible for:

Managing employee records

Monitoring attendance

Reviewing and approving leave requests

Managing payroll structures

Admins act as decision‑makers and supervisors within the system.

No other personas are supported.

4. Problems the Product Solves
Dayflow is designed to solve the following problems:

Scattered employee records

Manual attendance tracking

Paper‑based or email‑based leave approvals

Lack of transparency in payroll information

Role confusion between employees and HR

The system centralizes these operations into a single, role‑aware interface.

5. Core Value Proposition
The core value of Dayflow lies in:

Clarity: Users always know what they can do and what they cannot

Workflow transparency: Approval states are visible and traceable

Role safety: Employees and Admins never overlap in authority

Ease of use: Simple tables, forms, and dashboards

Dayflow prioritizes understanding over complexity.

6. Key Product Capabilities
The product delivers value through the following core capabilities:

6.1 Employee Capabilities
Secure login and logout

View personal profile information

Edit limited personal details

Mark daily attendance

Apply for leave

View leave status

View payroll details

6.2 Admin / HR Capabilities
View all employee profiles

Edit full employee details

Monitor and edit attendance records

Review, approve, or reject leave requests

Manage payroll structures

Maintain organizational visibility

7. Product Boundaries (Intentional Limits)
Dayflow is not intended to:

Perform payroll calculations

Process salary payments

Enforce labor law compliance

Act as a legally binding HR system

Replace enterprise HR platforms

These boundaries are intentional and protect the product from scope creep.

8. Success Criteria
The product is considered successful when:

All defined user flows work end‑to‑end

Role‑based access is enforced without leaks

Users can navigate without instructions

HR workflows are clearly demonstrated

The system can be explained in a short demo

Success is measured by clarity and completeness, not scale.

9. Alignment With Documentation
This product vision must align with:

PROJECT_SCOPE.md

APP_FLOW.md

USER_JOURNEYS.md

CORE_SAFETY.md

If a feature or decision does not support this vision, it must not be implemented.

10. Non‑Negotiable Vision Rule
Dayflow must always remain a clear, role‑driven HR workflow system.

Any feature, design choice, or AI suggestion that:

Adds unnecessary complexity

Blurs role boundaries

Distracts from core HR workflows

Is considered misaligned with the product vision.
