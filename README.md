# 🚀 Dayflow — Human Resource Management System
### Every workday, perfectly aligned.

> A role-driven, workflow-oriented Human Resource Management System designed with **enterprise thinking**, built under **hackathon constraints**, and aligned with **real organizational processes**.

## ✨ Why Dayflow Exists

Modern organizations don’t fail because of lack of tools.  
They fail because of **poor workflow design**.

Manual attendance.
Scattered approvals.
Opaque payroll visibility.
Unclear role boundaries.

**Dayflow** was built to fix exactly that.

Not by adding more features —  
but by **designing a system that thinks like HR does**.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy (This Is Where We Win)

Most hackathon projects start with *“what can we build?”*  
We started with *“how does this actually work in the real world?”*

Dayflow is built on four principles:

- **Role clarity over feature overload**
- **Approval workflows over direct edits**
- **Visibility without loss of control**
- **Design before development**

This philosophy guided **every decision** — from wireframes to database tables.

- **Problem Statement:** Dayflow – Human Resource Management System  
- **Duration:** 8-hour high-intensity sprint  
- **Mentor:** **Divyesh Vyas (Odoo)**  
- **Evaluation Criteria:**  
  - System thinking  
  - Workflow design  
  - Real-world applicability  
  - Code–design alignment  

> This project was built under strict time constraints, mentor checkpoints, and evaluation-driven milestones.

## 👥 Team

**Team Leader**  
- Jaymin Dattani  

**Team Members**  
- Ruchit Doshi  
- Rudrasinh Revar  
- Jeet Thakrar  

> Contributions spanned requirement analysis, UI/UX flow design, backend logic, and documentation — ensuring the system evolved as a **cohesive product**, not isolated features.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional HR operations suffer from:

- Manual or semi-digital attendance tracking  
- Delayed leave approvals  
- Poor transparency for employees  
- High administrative overhead for HR  
- Fragmented tools with no single source of truth  

The challenge was to build a **centralized HRMS** that enforces structure without sacrificing usability.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Dayflow

**Dayflow** is a **role-based HRMS** that centralizes core HR workflows into a single, controlled system.

It introduces:
- Clear separation between **Employee** and **Admin/HR**
- Approval-driven actions
- Read-only visibility where integrity matters
- Scalable architecture aligned with enterprise needs

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Secure Sign Up / Sign In
- Role selection at onboarding
- Input validation and session handling
- Permission-guarded access to features

---

### 👤 Employee Profile Management
- Centralized employee records
- Personal, job, and salary details
- Limited edit access for employees
- Full control for Admin/HR

---

### ⏱️ Attendance Management
- Daily & weekly attendance views
- Status types:
  - Present
  - Absent
  - Half-Day
  - Leave
- Employee access limited to self
- Admin/HR organization-wide visibility

---

### 📝 Leave & Time-Off Management
- Structured leave application flow
- Leave lifecycle:
  - Pending → Approved / Rejected
- Admin/HR approval interface
- Instant reflection in records

---

### 💰 Payroll Visibility
- Transparent salary breakdown
- Read-only access for employees
- Admin/HR control over salary components
- Designed for trust, accuracy, and compliance

---

## 🧠 System Design Methodology

We followed a **design-first, system-oriented workflow**:

1. Formal problem understanding (SRS)
2. Wireframe & flow mapping
3. Role-based permission modeling
4. Backend logic aligned with workflows
5. UI built to reflect system behavior

This ensured **zero disconnect** between what was designed and what was implemented.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  

### Backend
- PHP  

### Database
- MySQL  

### Tools
- Git & GitHub (collaboration & versioning)
- Excalidraw (wireframes & system flows)

> The stack was chosen to prioritize **clarity, stability, and logic-driven development** — not hype.

## 📊 Why Dayflow Stands Out

✔ Built around real HR workflows  
✔ Strong role and permission boundaries  
✔ Approval-based data integrity  
✔ Clear documentation and wireframes  
✔ Mentor-guided development  
✔ Scalable beyond hackathon scope  

This project demonstrates **engineering maturity**, not just coding ability.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Advanced analytics & dashboards  
- Exportable salary slips & attendance reports  
- Email / in-app notifications  
- Integration with biometric or camera-based attendance  
- Expansion into full ERP-style HR ecosystem

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

We extend our sincere thanks to **Divyesh Vyas (Odoo)** for continuous mentorship and critical feedback.  
We also thank the **Odoo x GCET Hackathon ’26** team for fostering a problem-solving-first environment.

## 🧠 Final Statement

> **Dayflow is not a prototype built to impress.  
It is a system designed to last.**

If evaluated on **thinking, structure, and real-world relevance**,  
Dayflow earns its place.
